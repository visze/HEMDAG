Installation
============

HEMDAG is available on CRAN as well as through Bioconda and also from source code. You can use one of the following ways for installing HEMDAG.


.. _conda:

Installation via Conda
========================

.. note::

    This is the recommended way of installing for normal users.

This is the recommended way to install HEMDAG because it will enables you to switch software versions easily. And in addition R with all needed dependencies will be installed.

First, you have to install the Miniconda Python3 distribution. See `here <https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html>`_ for installation instructions. Make sure to ...

 - Install the *Python 3* version of Miniconda.
 - Answer yes to the question whether conda shall be put into your PATH.

Then, you can install HEMDAG with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge r-hemdag

from the `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ channel.

Global Installation
========================

You can directly install the library via R by issuing

.. code-block:: console

    $ R -e "install.packages('HEMDAG',repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')"

in your terminal. But be sure to install R properly before that command.

.. _install_from_source:

Installing from Source
=======================

.. note::

    You only need to install from source if you want to develop HEMDAG yourself.


This section describes how to build HEMDAG from scratch.

Prequisites
-----------

For building HEMDAG, you will need the following dependencies

 - R (â‰¥ 2.10)
 - R-libraries:
    - PerfMeas
    - rbgl (bioconductor)
    - graph (bioconductor)
    - precrec
    - preprocessCore  (bioconductor)

Git Checkout
------------

In this tutorial, we will download the HEMDAG sources and build them in ``~/HEMDAG``:

.. code-block:: console

  ~ $ cd ~
  ~ $ git clone https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/HEMDAG.git HEMDAG
  ~ $ cd HEMDAG

Building
--------

You can build HEMDAG using ``TODO``:

.. code-block:: console

  ~ # TODO
